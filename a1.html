        <h1>Fast Food</h1>
        <p>
        Fast food is a type of mass-produced food designed for commercial resale, with a strong priority placed on speed of
        service. Fast food is a commercial term, limited to food sold in a restaurant or store with frozen, preheated or
        precooked ingredients and served in packaging for take-out or takeaway. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy
        to accommodate large numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers. In 2018, the fast-food industry was worth an
        estimated $570 billion globally.
        
        The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals which reduce waiting periods to mere seconds. Other
        fast-food outlets, primarily hamburger outlets such as McDonald's and Burger King, use mass-produced, pre-prepared
        ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are pre-washed, pre-sliced, or both;
        etc.) and cook the meat and french fries fresh, before assembling "to order".
        
        Fast-food restaurants are traditionally distinguished by the drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may
        provide no shelter or seating, or fast-food restaurants (also known as quick-service restaurants). Franchise
        operations that are part of restaurant chains have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central
        locations.
        
        Many fast foods tend to be high in saturated fat, sugar, salt and calories. Fast-food consumption has been linked to
        increased risk of cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, insulin resistance conditions
        and depression. These correlations remain strong even when controlling for confounding lifestyle variables,
        suggesting a strong association between fast-food consumption and increased risk of disease and early mortality.
